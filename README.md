# Mark Copy full stack technical test

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

   - A coding project (should take 1 to 4 hours depending on your level)
   - A few questions about your technical choices during the next meeting


# Instructions

You are not starting from an empty project, you will find some TODOS that will guide you.

The goal of this project is to
    
    Use .json file to create dynamic pages for different templates
    
    Display generated content
    
    You are not required to serve this separately from the dev server (i.e. npm start).

    Use the returned data to display a page of results that matches the given design.



# Design

Mark Copy uses Material-UI but you are free to use any other library that you're more comfortable with.


# Data source

We have made a public API: https://apitest.markcopy.ai

You will receive an API key after your first interview call.


# Running the project


# Deliverable

We accept both a Github public repository or a ZIP file shared via Google Drive.
